              <h2>Life and Death Of Albert Einstein</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>He was born on the <strong>14th of March, 1879</strong> at
Ulm Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire</li>
<li>Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a <strong>14-year-old</strong> he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus</li>
<li>In <strong>September 1896</strong> he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6</li>
<li>At the <strong>age of 17</strong>, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in <strong>1900</strong>.</li>
<li>After graduating in <strong>1900</strong>, Einstein spent almost two years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in <strong>February 1901</strong>, but was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father, he secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner – level III</li>
<li>Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time</li>
<li>With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in <strong>1902</strong>, self-mockingly named "The Olympia Academy", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy, Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.</li>
<li>In <strong>1900</strong>, Einstein's paper "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" ("Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik. On <strong>30 April 1905</strong> Einstein completed his dissertation, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions with Alfred Kleiner, serving as pro-forma advisor. His thesis was accepted in <strong>July 1905</strong>, and Einstein was awarded a PhD on <strong>15 January 1906</strong></li>
<li>Also in <strong>1905</strong>, he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the <strong>age of 26</strong>.</li>
<li>By <strong>1908</strong>, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, He was appointed associate professor in <strong>1909</strong>.</li>
<li>Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in <strong>April 1911</strong>, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.</li>
<li>From <strong>1912</strong> until <strong>1914</strong>, he was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics.</li>
<li>He died on the <strong>18th of April 1955</strong> (aged 76)
Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.</li>
